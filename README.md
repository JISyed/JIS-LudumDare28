JIS-LudumDare28
===============

This base of this project can be found in GraphicsWrapperBase.zip. It's based off the tutorial provided by [open.gl](http://open.gl) except everything is organized in classes and I wrote a graphics controller that makes OpenGL a little easier to use.

In order to prevent linker errors, see Libraries.zip for the needed libraries. They must be put into the C drive.

Due to the time, the scope of the game will be tiny.
